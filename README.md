# things

so you come back when i do these things?? i wonder dude...

that we have not done very much in the last while... or have we?? you hesitation to pay makes me think you won't pay.  and then i have nothing lol....  oh well i'll just repair my brain and heal up before going out for work as a programmer

so this is the first monster.  starting off slow. ifeel i bought some really good weed cause my head is whacking out from it.  for average dosages too.  weird.  or last times supply was shitty i couldn't tell.  indica is lame bro.  anyways.  i'll smoke them all but what do we still have here? nothing.  maybe i am understanding i should actually not know you cause you stink.  so things were the way they are...  another dream another hope.  this one seems backed up by us treasury.  an evil instituion...

so things were somtehing.. i wonder a lot of things every day and this guy just won't sent my monees. did you think i was going to be a degenerate about it??  i wonder this clean person with his hand in every sort of conflict.  lots of curiosities.  something like that.  some shit like that.  i wonder if i do this work you will actualy be happy with the results.  i am poorly lacking any optimisim for things though.  life just harder bro...  i just dont know why you are here putting me in chains again???

too much brain power everytime we do this.  i dont know how to tell you i am sorta tired of this shit.  the problem is there is never a good day...  last one i got from you was pretty fun.  its too late to say things now.  it happened...  i wonder you hear those words from me you become disturbed...  i wonder dude.  that we do too much this thing becomes confusing.

oh well i must have some optimizations for this.  if anyone were to have one.  it would be me.  so how does it feel???  if its not a problem its okay until you screw up bigger.  you know what i'm saying??? i sure hope so.  like your class structure it didn't really matter in the real run.  the real one.  so i ask you how you fail so much here that something comes up you are incompetent.  so i live with your shit bro.  i dont consider what i did really worth the work you forgot to pay  me.  perhaps the emergency button should be pressed sooner. i have no prospects for you...  somethings like this... or that...

you know what i really think of this?? a game of waiting cause this retard loves my wavelengths.  something you ordered.  from me.  now its time to pay???  i wonder how much ultristic concepts that i didn't save someone from my usual hell..  cause i dont know how to deal with it lol...  you would understand that i bet...  i bet lol.

lousy shit is what it is.  you stink of burden bro.  i dont mind doing this but you ordered this one and you pretend some shit so you can hide and not pay...  is that what this is? i feel so... unfortunately.

so the last bits of the last drink.  3 monsters lol...  i wonder dude, what we are doing here...  what kind of things were supposed to happen?? why you can't pay for my shit why pretend???  i couldn't tell when a lottery winner beat me lol.  so i wonder my problems you would complain about them.  rather you just not and dont be in the picture.  you left it this broke and i am only living it because you are lame.  nothing else should have happened.  i am entitled to those rights lol... i mean the work itself was pretty simple.  i just was left with crippling debt lol...  so i mean things got done. by this stupid shark for his problems are caused by me.   i wonder you understand our relationship now...  that you knew this you chose this probable state and such. nothing fancy i would say...

you know, i think i got it finally.  you just like free shit or something.  how come i now officialy own mk ultra patterns your retarded ass was here for too long.  i mean, where is the payment for such services.  you pay when you collect enough wavelengths?  fuck me if i know.  stupid mister clean lol...

burden you say?  even my ass is carrying shit.  i wonder when i get compensated for it.  so it is a true fact that burdens are bad...  so we tried to get rid of it but people think its free or something.  ethical lines of retardation.  moronic phd.  fuck him if i knew.  so you see, you have spent my patience on things. now i remember the thing i avoided but ended up doing it anyways lol...  like this notion that we could avoid what happened...  that i cheat reality with my freebees.  it loooks funny from this pov.  too free.  how annoyed were you by it???

oh but you pay??? when the fuck is this thing over lol...  derp.  a clown a day leaves the doctor at bay.
