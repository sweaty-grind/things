# things

so you come back when i do these things?? i wonder dude...

that we have not done very much in the last while... or have we?? you hesitation to pay makes me think you won't pay.  and then i have nothing lol....  oh well i'll just repair my brain and heal up before going out for work as a programmer

so this is the first monster.  starting off slow. ifeel i bought some really good weed cause my head is whacking out from it.  for average dosages too.  weird.  or last times supply was shitty i couldn't tell.  indica is lame bro.  anyways.  i'll smoke them all but what do we still have here? nothing.  maybe i am understanding i should actually not know you cause you stink.  so things were the way they are...  another dream another hope.  this one seems backed up by us treasury.  an evil instituion...

so things were somtehing.. i wonder a lot of things every day and this guy just won't sent my monees. did you think i was going to be a degenerate about it??  i wonder this clean person with his hand in every sort of conflict.  lots of curiosities.  something like that.  some shit like that.  i wonder if i do this work you will actualy be happy with the results.  i am poorly lacking any optimisim for things though.  life just harder bro...  i just dont know why you are here putting me in chains again???
